Requirements:
 apache, php 5, curl

What:
	pbot is a command line version of proxybot.  You can either scrape for a new proxy, check if existing proxies are up, or check the anonymity level of a proxy

How:
	Call grabproxy.php and get a list of proxies to stdout.  Pipe to a temp file and call testproxy with the same option you called grabproxy with; outputs a list of working proxies in the proxychains format.
	If you want to test proxy anonymity levels, you must have pbot in an internet accessible folder. You must pass the hostname+path to pbot in order to test for anonymity level.
	Pbot does not allow you to select which sites to scrape proxies from, it randomly chooses for you based on the amount of proxies you would like returned. 

	Usage: php grabproxy.php [-option] [int]
	-c               Proxies separated by commas
	-h               This help menu
	-n               Proxies separated by newlines
	int              Maximum number of proxies to return (optional)
	option           What format to save list as
	If no maximum number is passed, returns OVER 9000 proxies

	Usage: php testproxy.php [-option] [hostname] [path]
	Or   : php grabproxy.php [-option] > [path] && php testproxy.php [-option] [hostname] [path]
	-h               This help menu
	-c               Proxies separated by commas
	-n               Proxies separated by newlines
	-a               Optional: Test anonymity level (requires hostname)
	option           What format to save list as
	path             Path to tmp folder location and file name
	Test if up: php grabproxy.php -n 100 > /tmp/pb.new && php testproxy.php -n /tmp/pb.new > /tmp/pb.good
	Test anonymity: php grabproxy.php -n 100 > /tmp/pb.new && php testproxy.php -n -a hysterix.com/pbot /tmp/pb.new > /tmp/pb.good

Why:
	Dedicated to all my niggaz who was down from day one.

Fun:
	quote of the day:
	 "LSD is a psychedelic drug which occasionally causes psychotic behavior in people who have NOT taken it."
